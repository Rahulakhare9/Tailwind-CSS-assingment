            <p class="font-mono "><b>His saga is the entrepreneurial crearation myth</b> write large:Jobs was born in San Francisco to a
                Syrian father and Swiss-German American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. He attended Reed
                College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking
                enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell
                Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with
                production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
                Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical
                user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by
                the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh
                introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first
                laser printer to feature vector graphics.</p>

                <p>Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism. In India, he experienced
                    Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey,[234] and his sense of intuition was influenced
                    by the spiritual people with whom he studied.[234] Jobs gained insights regarding industrial designs
                    from Richard Sapper.[235]

                    According to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't an engineer and he
                    didn't do any original design...".[236][237] Daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a
                    college friend of Jobs, stated: "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve
                    Jobs was the marketing person."[238]

                    He is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent
                    applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user
                    interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps,
                    sleeves, lanyards, and packages. His contributions to most of his patents were to "the look and feel
                    of the product". He and his industrial design chief Jonathan Ive are named for 200 of the
                    patents.[239]</p>
